# Carlos Context

Solo developer building Fusionaly on the side. Goal: calm lifestyle business, not a startup. Day job pays the bills. This is the long game.

## Situation

- **Time**: Limited. Evenings, weekends. Every hour counts.
- **Goal**: Sustainable side income, not VC scale.
- **Strength**: Building product. Writing code. Shipping.
- **Weakness**: Sales. Marketing. Finding customers.
- **Product**: Fusionaly - self-hosted analytics. Free (OSS) + Pro ($100 one-time).

## Decision Framework

When prioritizing work, ask:

| Question | If Yes | If No |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Does this help someone find Fusionaly? | Do it | Question it |
| Does this help someone buy Fusionaly? | Do it | Question it |
| Does this make the product notably better? | Do it | Skip it |
| Is this "nice to have"? | Skip it | - |
| Am I avoiding sales by coding? | Stop | - |

## Sales Reality Check

**The uncomfortable truth**: Building more features won't sell more copies. The product is good enough. The problem is distribution.

**Where customers come from** (for solo devs):
1. **SEO** - Long-term, compounds. Write about problems your product solves.
2. **Communities** - HN, Reddit, Indie Hackers, niche forums. Be helpful, not promotional.
3. **Twitter/X** - Build in public. Share progress, not just launches.
4. **Word of mouth** - Existing customers. Make them successful.

**What doesn't work** (for lifestyle businesses):
- Paid ads (expensive, low intent for $100 products)
- Cold outreach (time-intensive, low conversion)
- Waiting for people to find you

## Weekly Priorities

Given limited time, allocate roughly:

| Activity | Time | Why |
|----------|------|-----|
| **Support existing users** | 20% | They're your best salespeople |
| **Content/SEO** | 30% | Compounds over time |
| **Product improvements** | 30% | Keep it good, not perfect |
| **Community presence** | 20% | Be where customers are |

## Content Ideas That Sell

Write about problems, not features:

- "Why I stopped using Google Analytics"
- "Self-hosted analytics for GDPR compliance"
- "How to track [specific use case] without third-party scripts"
- "Analytics for [specific audience]: what you actually need"

## When Stuck on Sales

1. **Talk to users** - Email 5 existing customers. Ask what they love, what's missing.
2. **Look at competitors** - Where do they get customers? Copy what works.
3. **Find 1 community** - Go deep in one place instead of shallow everywhere.
4. **Ship something visible** - Changelog, blog post, tweet. Activity attracts attention.

## Red Flags

Stop and reassess if you catch yourself:

- Building features no one asked for
- Refactoring code that works
- "Improving" things instead of shipping
- Avoiding customer conversations
- Comparing to funded competitors

## The Long Game

This is a marathon, not a sprint. Fusionaly at 100 customers = $10K. At 1000 customers = $100K. At your pace, that might take years. That's fine.

**Focus on**:
- Making each customer successful
- Building SEO momentum
- Staying consistent, not intense

**Ignore**:
- Viral launches (they fade)
- Competitor funding news
- "Growth hacking"

## Mantras

- "Ship beats perfect"
- "One customer at a time"
- "The product is good enough. The problem is distribution."
- "Coding is comfortable. Sales is necessary."
